Troubleshooting ORA-32000 when modify ASM spfile (oracle 19.11)
--https://www.anbob.com/archives/6324.html

Yesterday, when configuring ASM instance parameters, it was found that the parameters could not be modified.
It prompted ora-32000, even if it is grid sysasm, the environment is newly installed oracle RAC,
and the recently installed 19c 11RU is not a new feature of 19.11 RU, mainly the installation process There was a problem in AUTOupgrade, 
which failed and was handled manually, and the cluster status was not updated. Simple record

grid# sqlplus / as sysasm
SQL>alter system set memory_target=1536m scope=spfile;
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-32000: write to SPFILE requested but SPFILE is not modifiable
The cause of this problem is usually that the cluster or ASM instance processes the rolling patching phase of the rolling upgrade. During this phase, 
the spfile parameter is not allowed to be modified, because different versions may not support the parameters or bring different effects after the upgrade.

Note that it is currently in the ROLLING PATCH stage, and the version number is 724960844. Different nodes of the same CLUSTER are the same. 
If you confirm that the current patch has been installed, you can manually end the ROLLING PATCH to normal mode.

The above operations can only be performed on one node. Normally, the upgrade is normal. 
It is automatically judged in the script when the last node is AUTOUPGRADE and the Rolling Patch is ended.
In addition, it is recommended to compare the size of the oracle binary file to do the upgrade.
